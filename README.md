# Hi, I'm lean-tom! 👋

I am a formal verification enthusiast focused on bridging mathematical intuition with machine-checked rigor using **Lean 4**.  
Currently, I contribute to the [dwrensha/compfiles](https://github.com/dwrensha/compfiles) project, exploring the synergy between human architecture and AI-assisted implementation through the formalization of IMO-level challenges.

### 💎 Featured Project: IMO 2025 Problem 6 (The Matilda Problem)
**[World's First Complete sorry-free Formalization]**

I successfully formalized the complete solution for this complex combinatorics problem. To address the critical challenge of "AI-generated code quality and verifiability," this project adopts a **two-stage approach**:

1.  **Rapid Prototyping (Completed):** Leveraged AI assistance to capture the full logical path, establishing an initial "existence proof" of the formalization.
2.  **Refinement & Standardization (Current Focus): > Guided by a commitment to human-led logical design—ensuring that the proof structure reflects sound mathematical intuition rather than Initial AI-assisted implementation—I am performing a comprehensive refactoring to meet Mathlib’s rigorous standards.
3.  
#### 🚀 Evolution & Refactoring (In Progress)
Using the redundant AI-generated prototype as a **"logical map,"** I am working to elevate the proof into an elegant mathematical formalization:

* **Statement Refinement (Completed): > Refactored Joseph Myers' original definition to utilize docs#NonemptyInterval, bringing it in line with modern Mathlib standards.
* **Proof Reconstruction (Researching/In Design):** Investigating methods to collapse the exhaustive **2×25 coordinate-based casework** into a concise proof. I am exploring concepts such as **signed parity, discrete vector fields, or potential functions** to maintain symmetry—strictly avoiding reliance on macro-based automation.
* **Goal:** Eliminate AI-derived verbosity and rebuild a formalization with a clear logical structure that conforms to library standards.

### 🧩 Technical Outlook & Research Interests
* **AI-Human Collaboration:** Methodologies where human mathematical intuition guides AI to produce verified "Ground Truth" data.
* **Scalable Formal Engineering:** Developing workflows to refactor long-form, "brute-force" AI proofs into elegant, abstract code.

### 🛠️ Status
I am a non-expert currently learning the ropes of Mathlib. I am always mindful of concerns regarding the "flood of low-quality AI-generated code" and am striving to produce work that truly contributes to the community. I highly welcome any feedback or advice on my refactoring process via Zulip.
