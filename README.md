# Hi, I'm lean-tom! 👋

I am a formal verification enthusiast focused on bridging mathematical intuition with machine-checked rigor using **Lean 4**.

Currently, I contribute to the **[dwrensha/compfiles](https://github.com/dwrensha/compfiles)** project, where I formalize IMO-level challenges to explore the synergy between human architecture and AI-assisted implementation.

## 💎 Featured Project: IMO 2025 Problem 6 (The Matilda Problem)
**[World's First Complete sorry-free Formalization]**

I successfully formalized the complete solution for this complex combinatorics problem. The project serves as a pilot case for **Rapid AI-Assisted Formalization**, capturing ~4,700 lines of verified logic in record time.

### 🚀 Evolution & Refactoring (In Progress)
Following the initial merge and community feedback from Zulip, I am currently refactoring the proof to align with Mathlib's idiomatic standards:
- **Optimization**: Transitioning to `docs#NonemptyInterval` to simplify rectangular boundary definitions.
- **Code Golfing**: Reducing the ~4,700-line prototype into a more concise, idiomatic Lean proof.
- **Architecture**: Utilizing an original **"Topological Pivot"** strategy to bypass grueling coordinate casework.

## 🧩 Technical Outlook & Research Interests
- **AI-Human Collaboration**: Developing workflows where human mathematical intuition guides AI to produce verified "Ground Truth" data for automated reasoning.
- **Scalable Formal Engineering**: Managing the lifecycle of large-scale proofs from rapid prototyping to high-standard library integration.
