# Hi, I'm lean-tom! 👋

I am a mathematics enthusiast focused on the formalization of mathematical problems using **Lean 4**.  
I am currently contributing to the **[dwrensha/compfiles](https://github.com/dwrensha/compfiles)** project, which aims to collect formalizations of olympiad-style mathematics problems.

🏆 Lean 4 Formalization Portfolio
Welcome to my formal verification repository. This project showcases my ability to bridge high-level mathematical reasoning with rigorous software engineering, focusing on the Lean 4 interactive theorem prover.

💎 Featured Project: IMO 2025 Problem 6 (The Matilda Problem)
[First complete formalization without sorry]

This is a world-first formalization of the most challenging problem from IMO 2025. The proof consists of ~4,500 lines of verified logic, demonstrating the capability to manage extreme complexity in formal systems.

🛠️ Technical Deep Dive

Lower Bound (Topological Combinatorics): * Applied the Erdős–Szekeres Theorem to grid coordinates.
Engineered a topological partitioning of the n×n grid into four distinct regions (W, N, E, S) based on the closures of maximal chains.
Formalized a "Pivot" region strategy to resolve the "Disjoint Case" where Longest Increasing/Descending Subsequences do not intersect.

Upper Bound (Number Theory & Construction):
Developed an explicit construction for n=2025 (n=k^2, k=45) using a system of linear congruences modulo k^2+1.
Verified the geometric equivalence between "Matilda tiles" and index-based fiber sets.

Engineering Excellence:
Managed a 4,500-line codebase ensuring it passes CI (lake build) with zero errors or sorry.

Prioritized verified logic and structural integrity, with plans for Lean Blueprint visualization.

## 🧩 Technical Outlook & Interests

My work in formal verification is driven by a deep interest in the following areas:

* **Designing Scalable AI Reasoning:** Exploring the intersection of LLMs and Formal Logic. I am interested in how formalizing extreme-scale proofs (like the 4,500-line IMO 2025 P6) can provide high-quality "ground truth" data for the next generation of reasoning-capable AI.
* **Proof Visualization & Architecture:** Interested in utilizing **Lean Blueprints** to manage and visualize the dependency graphs of complex formalizations, ensuring that large-scale proofs remain maintainable and transparent.
* **Formal Foundations:** Continuously exploring mathematical frameworks that serve as the bedrock for modern computational sciences.
