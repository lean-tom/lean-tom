# Hi, I'm lean-tom! 👋

I am a mathematics enthusiast focused on the formalization of mathematical problems using **Lean 4**.  
I am currently contributing to the **[dwrensha/compfiles](https://github.com/dwrensha/compfiles)** project, which aims to collect formalizations of olympiad-style mathematics problems.

### 🚀 Formalization Portfolio

#### 🟢 Integrated (Merged)
- **IMO 1971 P6** ([Pull Request](https://github.com/dwrensha/compfiles/pull/143)) - Proof of the $n^2/2$ lower bound for the sum of entries in a non-negative integer matrix.
- **IMO 1968 P6** ([Pull Request](https://github.com/dwrensha/compfiles/pull/142)) - Formal verification of an infinite sum identity: $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \lfloor \frac{n + 2^k}{2^{k+1}} \rfloor = n$.
- **IMO 1961 P2** ([Source Code](https://github.com/dwrensha/compfiles/blob/main/Compfiles/Imo1961P2.lean)) - Formal proof of **Weitzenböck's Inequality**: $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \ge 4\sqrt{3}T$.

#### 🟡 In Review / Submitted
- **IMO 1986 P3** ([Pull Request](https://github.com/dwrensha/compfiles/pull/146)) - Proof of termination for a discrete dynamical system involving integer assignments on a pentagon.
