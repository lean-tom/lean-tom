# Hi, I'm lean-tom! 👋

I am a formal verification enthusiast focused on bridging mathematical intuition with machine-checked rigor using **Lean 4**.  
Currently, I contribute to the [dwrensha/compfiles](https://github.com/dwrensha/compfiles) project, exploring the synergy between human architecture and AI-assisted implementation.

### 💎 Featured Project: IMO 2025 Problem 6 (The Matilda Problem)
**[World's First Complete sorry-free Formalization]**

I successfully formalized the complete solution for this complex combinatorics problem. The initial 4,700-line prototype was refined with invaluable autogolfing assistance from **David Renshaw** and merged into `compfiles`. This serves as the verified "scaffold" for my ongoing exploration of structural elegance.

* **Initial Milestone (Completed):** Established a verified baseline through a brute-force approach. I am deeply grateful to **Mirek Olšák** for his encouraging comments during this phase, which validated the significance of this first step.
* **Refinement & Standardization (Current Focus):** Guided by a commitment to human-led logical design and valuable feedback from **Kevin Buzzard**, I am performing a comprehensive refactoring to meet Mathlib’s high standards for elegance and maintainability.

#### 🚀 Evolution & Refactoring (In Progress)
Inspired by the vision shared by **Leonardo de Moura**, I am working to elevate the proof from low-level coordinate manipulation to high-level strategic transitions.

* **Intensive Study Phase (Current Focus):** Before proceeding with major code changes, I am dedicating time to **analyzing Mathlib’s core APIs and documentation**. I am particularly focused on studying **Joseph Myers’ proofs** to understand the "design patterns" of idiomatic Lean, ensuring my refactored code contributes to the library's long-term health.
* **Statement Refinement:** (Completed) Refactored the definition to utilize `docs#NonemptyInterval` based on technical suggestions from **Joseph Myers**.
* **Proof Reconstruction (Researching/In Design):** Investigating mathematical avenues—such as **signed parity, discrete vector fields, or potential functions**—to collapse the 2×25 casework. I am exploring how to encapsulate these concepts into high-level structural lemmas that serve as clear, strategic steps in the proof.
* **Goal:** Distill the 4,000-line "scaffold" into a concise, idiomatic formalization (Target: <1,000 lines).

### 🧩 Technical Outlook & Interests
* **Human-AI Collaboration:** Exploring flexible workflows where human intuition guides AI to produce verified, high-quality "Ground Truth" data.
* **Scalable Formal Engineering:** Developing methods to refactor long-form, "brute-force" AI proofs into elegant, abstract code.

### 🛠️ Status
I am currently in a **"intensive learning" phase**, prioritizing the study of Mathlib's documentation and expert codebases over active implementation. I believe that mastering the idiom is a prerequisite for high-quality formalization. 

I am deeply grateful for the community's support, especially **David Renshaw** for his guidance. I welcome any advice or insights on Mathlib best practices via Zulip.

*(Note: I actively leverage Gemini as a collaborative partner to bridge linguistic gaps and accelerate the formalization process, ensuring my contributions are clear and respectful within this international community.)*
